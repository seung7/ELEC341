% Set-Point Time Vector
% =====================

% The Time Vector is stored in a variable called "Time".
% It's initial value is equally spaced for all samples and is
% set in TRAJECTORY.M
%
% Redefine this vector here to optimize the build time of the part.
% You can define it analytically or type in the elements manually but
% you must not change the length because it must contain one value for
% each Xd/Yd position pair.
% In the Matlab window, enter "length(Time)" to see how big it is.

% The Time vector must range from 0 to TotalTime

%Time       = 0:SampleTime:TotalTime;       % DO NOT CHANGE TotalTime
